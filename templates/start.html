    <div class="narrativeBox">

        <p>The bright afternoon sunbeams cut through the trees as your bus travels down the tan cobblestone roads of the town of Solanthi.
            You can hear the not so distant sound of waves crashing against the shoreline. The smell of sea salt rolls in through the 
            cracked bus window filling your senses. 
        </p>

        <p>"Alright everybody! We're here!" The bus drivers hearty voice chimes over the speaker system.
            "I hope you all enjoy your stay in our wonderful town of Solanthi!" He grabs the door level and pulls it open, a giant 
            burst of air rushing in, welcoming and greeting you.
        </p>

        <p>Slowly everyone shuffles off the bus, and as you descend the steps you look up at the view in front of you. 
            Directly in front of your stands your hotel, tall and statuesque. It's golden paint almost shimmers in the sunlight, and 
            embedded in some of it's stone line are jewels of sapphire and emerald, complimented with vine like paintings in the same 
            colors, with some purple and gold as well. It's very a ornate building that looks like it's been around for years but has 
            enjoyed some modern upgrades. You press the large teal glass doors open and step inside. 
        </p>











        
        <p>"Welcome to Solaris Hotel!" The hotel attendant sees the golden ticket in your hand with it's QR code. 
            "Ah! You must be {{ session['name'] }}! Congratulations on winning our vacation giveaway! Let's get you checked in right 
            away!" You see her extend a scanner over the lobby desk and a red laser flashes over your ticket, a successful beep chirps.
            "Perfect! I've got all your information right here for you! Please enjoy your beach facing room on the fourth floor. If you 
            need anything please do not hesitate to call down and let our staff know! We'll be more than happy to assist you!"
        </p>

        <p>
            "Before I let you go I'd like to let you know that you've come during a wonderful time! We have a special exhibit in the museum 
            going on right now to celebrate our citys rich history!"
        </p>

        
        <p>You exit the bus and enter the hotel lobby. They scan your barcode for your hotel room.</p>
